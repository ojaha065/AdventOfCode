# Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory

As a warmup for 2022 I decided to complete some old ones from 2020.

First 2D array of this year. These always make my head hurt at first but are actually fairly simple after you get the hang of it.

## The puzzle

Suppose you have the following map:
```
..##.......
#...#...#..
.#....#..#.
..#.#...#.#
.#...##..#.
..#.##.....
.#.#.#....#
.#........#
#.##...#...
#...##....#
.#..#...#.#
```

The same pattern repeats to the right infinitely.

### Part 1

Starting at the top-left corner of your map and following a slope of **right 3 and down 1**, how many trees (marked with `#`) would you encounter?

### Part 2

Determine the number of trees (marked with `#`) you would encounter if, for each of the following slopes, you start at the top-left corner and traverse the map all the way to the bottom:

- Right 1, down 1
- Right 3, down 1
- Right 5, down 1
- Right 7, down 1
- Right 1, down 2
