# Day 1: Report Repair

As a warmup for 2022 I decided to complete some old ones from 2020.

Nothing worth mentioning about this one. Just some nested for loops. Ugly and inefficient as hell, but works.

## The puzzle

Part 1: Find the two entries from the list that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?

Part 2: Find the **three** entries from the list that sum to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?
