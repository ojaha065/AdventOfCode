# Day four: Giant Squid

Really liked this one. Also got a super fast time in part two as my part one solution also worked for part two with only three lines of code changed. Sadly part one took me way too much time to have any chance of getting to the leaderboard regardless.

My original code was messy garbage so did some heavy refactoring on this one before committing.
