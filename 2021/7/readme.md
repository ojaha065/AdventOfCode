# Day seven: The Treachery of Whales

Oh no, more math! :worried: Fortunately this one could be done just by "brute forcing" it by calculating the fuel cost for every single possible X coordinate. I'm certain there's some fancy math formula out there that I could've used but it would've probably taken me more time to figure those out than write these nested loops... :sweat_smile:

My original solution only calculated the fuel cost for every X coordinate that already had a crab in it. By a stroke of luck that actually worked for part 1 but would not return a correct answer for part two. Took me a five to figure out what was happening.
