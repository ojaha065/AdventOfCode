# Day 16: Packet Decoder

Very long puzzle instructions today. Took me like half an hour and multiple read-throughs to understand everything but after that the actual coding part went pretty well.

Really happy how the code turned out. First time for me using recursion in class constructor like that. JavaScript has really gone forward from those IE6 days. :smile:
