# Day eight: Seven Segment Search

Man, part two was so brutal today. Took me multiple hours to come up with a plan how it could be done and even had to take a quick peek into the subreddit to get some inspiration and ideas from others' solutions. After coming up with a game plan coding it went pretty fast tho.

Not proud of my solution today, as afterwards I saw multiple better, clearer and cleverer solutions online. Oh well, at least got the stars.
