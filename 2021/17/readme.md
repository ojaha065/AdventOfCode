# Day 17: Trick Shot

Easy going today. Actually got my best combined position on the leaderboard so far (1345/973). :tada:

I'm certain there's some way to calculate the optimal start and end points for the loops. I just picked random range between -1000 and 1000 and it worked just fine, it just takes a couple of seconds to run. I also think this could be correctly solved purely using some fancy math formula without doing any looping. But for me it was swifter to figure it out this way.
