# Day nine: Smoke Basin

A lot easier one today compared to the yesterdays puzzle. Part two required implementing a basic [Flood fill algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_fill "Flood fill").

## The puzzle

Consider the following heightmap:
```
2199943210
3987894921
9856789892
8767896789
9899965678
```

Part 1: Find all of the low points on your heightmap.
Part 2: A basin is all locations that eventually flow downward to a single low point. What do you get if you multiply together the sizes of the three largest basins?
