# Day five: Hydrothermal Venture

Another fun one. I must admit, it has been a while since my last math lesson and I'm sure there are many far more optimal and faster ways to complete this one. (e.g. vector math?) My solution takes about 15 seconds to run on my machine and it was one heck of headache to get it working. Nevertheless, still managed the complete it just under one hour. On top of that, I again got a very fast delta between part one and part two.

Committing this one pretty much as is. Only did minor cleanup, added some comments and refactored the main method to be 100% functional instead of imperative.

One last thing: I've been informed that I should not be publishing the actual inputs. [Apparently the author of Advent of Code prefers to not have them published.](https://twitter.com/ericwastl/status/1465805354214830081 "Eric Wastl") So I now gitignored the actual input files. Before today, I actually didn't even realize that each player got different input.
